# mastermind-game
Mastermind is a code-breaking game where you guess a 4-digit code (digits 1-6) within 10 tries. Feedback is given after each guess: + for correct digits in the right position and - for correct digits in the wrong position. Use logic and deduction to crack the code before running out of attempts!
